# USGS_water_data_rdb_to_csv
A project that takes rdb data from USGS's website https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ and converts it to csv


Included in this repo is a jupyter notebook that was used to originally explore the data and set up the process to 
convert the rdb data to csv. Also included is a python script to run that takes a name of already downloaded water use rdb file
and converts it to csv as well. 

More information about the data can be found at https://water.usgs.gov/watuse/WU-Category-Changes.html. The website knows that 
their data is in outdated formats and they are working on updating it. This program is intended to address the need
to put the file in a more updated format.
